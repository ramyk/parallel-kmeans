# parallel-kmeans
Some gists of k-means algorithm parallelization in MPI, OpenMP &amp; TBB.
Each library is used to parallelize the algorithm in a different manner for a more diverse benchmarking.

TODO:

    - [ ] Restructurize repo's into a more *project-like* hierarchy
    - [ ] Add CMake building directives *(or just a simple makefile may do it too)*
    - [ ] Push benchmarking plots
    - [ ] Update README.md file for repo changes
