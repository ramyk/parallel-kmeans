# parallel-kmeans
Some gists of k-means algorithm parallelization in MPI, OpenMP &amp; TBB.
Each library is used to parallelize the algorithm in a different manner for a more diverse benchmarking.

### TODO:

- [ ] Restructurize repo's into a more *project-like* hierarchy
- [ ] Add CMake building directives *(or just a simple makefile may do it too)*
- [ ] Push benchmarking plots
- [ ] Update README.md file for repo changes
